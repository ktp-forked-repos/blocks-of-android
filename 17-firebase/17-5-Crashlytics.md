# Crashlytics

Crashing of an app is a developer’s worst nightmare. It not only causes dissatisfaction among users but also leads to negative reviews which furthers reduces the user base of the application.
Finding the sources of crashes and fixing them requires a hell lot of time, firebase Crashlytics is a lightweight, realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality. Crashlytics saves you troubleshooting time by intelligently grouping crashes and highlighting the circumstances that lead up to them.
Its capabilities include:
•	Curated crash reports
•	Cures for common crash
•	Analytics 
•	Realtime alerts
The dashboard shows crashes ranked by overall impacts. The crashes are intelligently grouped by the versions of the app.
Also, logs are available for the crashes that took place which play a major role in understanding the non-reproducible errors. The code failures that do not necessarily crash the app are also recorded.
It is integrated with android applications with absolutely zero lines of code. All you have to do is setup the firebase crashlytics as explained in the setup section.
